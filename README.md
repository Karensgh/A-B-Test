# A-B-Test


Pippin is a San Francisco-based startup founded in 2017. The firm has been a disruptor in the music streaming industry. The Pippin app allows users to listen to hundreds of million songs at an affordable monthly price. You work as a data scientist at Pippin. In the last few weeks, Pippin has launched an A/B test to optimize subscriber conversion. You have been asked to analyze the test results and to deliver a short presentation to the broader project team including the members of Product Management, Marketing, Finance, and Engineering.


Assignment:
• Analyze the accompanying dataset (Pippin_subsciptions_data.csv) and develop actionable insights
• Create a 15 mins presentation that includes
o Overview of subscription conversion trends
o A/B test results
o Recommendations for the A/B test and overall subscription growth
• Be prepared to answer questions that your manager or peers may have during the review session. Your team is comfortable with looking at code if
needed. However, the broader project team prefers a business presentation.
